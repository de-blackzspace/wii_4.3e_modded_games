Installer for WiiGator's cMIOS

What is this?
This program patches the MIOS to allow booting of gamecube homebrew on a Wii and also patches the MIOS to enable DVD-R access. For gamecube homebrew and backups you need a loader that boots gamecube homebrew/boots gamecube games with a gamecube homebrew loader, for example NeoGamma R9.

Hint:
Get the required MIOS files as wad on sd card before starting HMP. You can easiliy download them with NUS Downloader
(see WiiBrew.org for download link). The expected name is:
RVL-mios-v4.wad

Known issues:
Gecko OS for gamecube edition can't boot games with this, "Error no DVD".
