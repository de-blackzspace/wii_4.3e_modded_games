How to "install" NeoGamma to sd card for use in the Homebrew Channel:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Copy the "apps" folder to the root of your sd card, so you have an "apps" folder on sd card,
which includes a "NeoGamma" folder, which includes the boot.dol(the program), the icon.png(optional,
the icon that is displayed in HBC) and the meta.xml(optional, contains the info discplayed in HBC)

The rest is optional, but recommended as it will help with some games(New Super Mario Bros, Sam & Max and some more):

- Create a "NeoGamma" folder on root of the sd card if there's none
- Copy the gameconfig.txt, the .wip and .wdm files to the "NeoGamma" folder(NOT the one under apps!)
[gameconfig.txt is for Brawl+, .wip files are patches, .wdm files are for alt .dol disc+]
- the "sourcecode" folder is not required at all for end users

Done

Get a channel at GBAtemp.net, there's no official channel yet, there are some channels in this thread:
http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=215712
I take no responsibility for any channel! Before installing a channel, make sure you have some brick protection
AND the channel is confirmed to work by other users.

A channel version will still require a sd card for some games, see above
