(1): Pass the contents of the folder "files" to the root of your SD card.
(2): Disconnect any Memory Card or GCN Controller. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
(3): Insert the SD card on your Wii and run Homebrew Channel (The homebrew must be 1.0.7 or higher). Run "IOS236 Installer/ Uninstaller"; Press 1 to install IOS236 and wait for a message on the screen "Getting IOS36 revision 3351". Now, select the option "Load IOS from SD card". When the installation finish, press any button to return to the HBC.
(4): Load the "cIOS rev20b Installer" app and choose the IOS 236 on the first screen using the D-pad and button A. On the selection of IOS Base, choose the "IOS56 v5661", then "IOS 249", then "WAD Installation" and then, "Wii SD Slot". When the installation finish, press A to continue with the process. Now you'll have to install the IOS 250. Now you´ll have to select again an IOS Base, so select the "IOS38 v4123" and then "IOS 250" (instead of IOS 249). Also, choose again "WAD Installation" and then "Wii SD Slot". When you finish, press the button B to return to the HBC.
(5): NOTE: NOW, IS THE INSTALLATION OF THE CHANNEL. IF YOU JUST WANT TO LOAD IT FROM HBC, YOU CAN SKIP THIS STEP. IF YOU WANT THE CHANNEL, FOLLOW THE NEXT INSTRUCCTIONS. On HBC, run WAD Installer 1.7. Then press A to continue, and select "IOS 249". Select "Disable" for the NAND option, then "Wii SD Slot". Search the folder "wad", then, select the "USB Loader GX-UNEO_Forwarder.wad" and install it. When the installation finish, press B and then HOME to return to the Homebrew Channel.
(6): Now, you can load the USB Loader GX from the Wii Menu or the app on HBC, but your SD card must be inserted to load the channel. Why? Becuase is a Forwarder, that run the application from SD card. I f you want to get ISO's, go to: wiiso.com, to install a videogame, insert the Discand select "install" and that's it.You will need WBFS Manager 3.0 to put the ISO's on your HDD or USB.
